Configuring an radio controller (RC) transmitter for Kerbal Space Program (KSP)! I found this to be realistic when controlling the vehicles. The setup is straight forward with no modifications or soldering needed! This post will take you through the following:

- Setting up a popular transmitter
- Downloading and configuring software to read from the transmitter
- KSP configuration.

## Setting up a Transmitter

An inexpensive and popular RC transmitter is the [FlySky FS-i6](https://amzn.to/2DkdOmy).  It's popular due the price, functionality, and the ability to modify.  It's highly recommended it for beginner drone or plane operators.  What is required is a transmitter that does PPM (Pulse Position Modulation) Which is an analog signal (similar to PWM) but all the channel information is stacked in the same length of the signal.  Using software, this can be decoded.  Most computers has an analog port on their computers, an microphone or "line in" port.  So that is the input in this case.  So this requires 2 pieces cords to do right.

- USB Data cable (While it may be possible to do it with this alone but it caused too many problems for me)
- Mono audio cable

## Download and Configure the Software

Once that is setup and plugged in to a microphone or "line in" port.  The next is to download [SmartPropoPlus](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartpropoplus/).  Select the audio port, 


##  Configure KSP


## Conclusion

So that's it!  The experience of using an RC transmitter for the game to be a good match.  It feels a lot closer to a flight simulator when using it this way.
