## Introduction

The cost of renting electric scooters was adding up.... so I made an alternative without breaking the bank. This blog post is all about building a diy electric skateboard.

## Basics

There are X major components to this build:

- Skateboard
- Electric motor with a KV rating for a single wheel. (follow up)
- Electric speed controller aka ESC
- Batteries usually LIPO as they are cheap.
- Transmitter controller
- Receiver to control the ESC

The batteries, motor, and receiver plug into the ESC. The batteries power the ESC. The ESC powers the receiver (5v regulated) and the electric motor. The electric motor spins the gear and belt.

That's all there is!
