Let's create a Bluetooth proximity detector using a Raspberry Pi, USB Bluetooth adapter, and a phone with Bluetooth enabled. This tutorial will guide you through the process of detecting a known Bluetooth device within range of the Raspberry Pi, without the need for pairing the devices.

**Step 1. Ensure USB Bluetooth is working on the Raspberry Pi.**  
Install `sudo apt-get install bluetooth`  
Check it Bluetooth status with this command: `hcitool dev`  
Should return the device's Bluetooth address: `Devices: hci0 00:00:00:00:00:17`

**Step 2. Getting the MAC address of a device.**
On an Android Phone version 6.0.1, Settings > System > About device > Status > Bluetooth address.

**Step 3. Test Connection to Client Device**  
Command: `sudo l2ping -c 2 00:11:22:AA:BB:CC`  
Result:  
`Ping: 00:11:22:AA:BB:CC from 00:00:00:00:00:17 (data size 44) ... 0 bytes from 00:11:22:AA:BB:CC id 0 time 7.32ms 0 bytes from 00:11:22:AA:BB:CC id 1 time 22.46ms`
