Rant post, maybe!?  A full stack engineer is knowing a lot about software/hardware but little about the details until needed.

## The Early Days

Imagine this.  Building your hardware, installing an OS, installing web and database hosting software, setting up a domain, setting up DNS, install SSL certifications, programming a website in html, css, javascript, c that will then be searchable on Google. Sounds familiar? Then you were a full stack engineer before 2010.
