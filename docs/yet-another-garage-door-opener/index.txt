Raspberry Pi!
Another tutorial for building a garage door opener with a raspberry pi. I've left the garage door opened too many times. Source: https://github.com/skittleson/garage-pi(https://github.com/skittleson/garage-pi)  This tutorial assumes you have a raspberry pi with wifi and the ability to ssh in.
Goals

Use Docker so it can easily be shared/restored/etc!
A simple web API for control

Use nodejs as much as possible for the build.
Toggle garage door
Status of garage door
Toggle light switch on the garage door
(optional) cheap camera to see what's going on.

What you will need

Relay modules. I only needed one - Channel DC 5V Relay Module for Arduino(https://amzn.to/2RP4zNC) 
Cheap containers to throw everything into - https://amzn.to/2NEdWwB(https://amzn.to/2NEdWwB) 
A replacement switch for garage door opener - Liftmaster 41A5273-1 Multi-Function Control Panel(https://amzn.to/2pShUrK) 
Raspberry Pi 3(https://amzn.to/2RMxQc5) 
(optional) great camera for the price! This one has 4 mics and the camera has two zoom modes. Sony Play Station Eye Camera for PS3(https://amzn.to/2CIAmvF) 

Research & Discover
There are a ton of these garage door projects. I was inspired by many of them. The LiftMaster garage door system has anti-tamper hardware measures which almost ended the project before it started. I decided to take a gamble and buy another garage door opener circuit that directly connects to the garage door unit. Bingo! Two circuits can be connected at the same time. Docker permissions and finding a base image for the raspberry pi took a few hours. Lesson learned, hardware interaction with docker can take a few extra steps.
Wiring
The relay module is stacked on top of the LiftMaster module then taped onto the Raspberry Pi. Note the relay connections are wired for normally opened. (click image to see larger version) Sealed up in a glad container (kinda hacky but it's cheap). This is the LiftMaster circuit. The narrower end has the button for opening the garage. The larger end has the button for the garage door light. The middle points are for the circuit to connect to main garage door unit. GPIO pin layout for the relays & reed switch not including power leads. Reed switch is connected to the part of the garage door (pin 18 and a ground). Once it moves away, then the reed switch is disconnected.
The entire setup. Messy but it's good enough. Cut some holes with a knife for wires and to hold it in place. The camera has been added with duck tape. Using a standard install of motion(https://motion-project.github.io/motion_build.html)  (no dockerfile tho).
Install
Install docker on the raspberry pi. https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/docker-comes-to-raspberry-pi/(https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/docker-comes-to-raspberry-pi/) 
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com(https://get.docker.com)  | sh
Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/skittleson/garage-pi(https://github.com/skittleson/garage-pi) 
cd garage-pi/

Run docker build for the image
docker build -t garage-pi .
Start the docker image in privileged mode. This will expose port 8090 for web access.
docker run -d --privileged -p 8090:8090 --name gpi garage-pi
Test it
curl http://localhost:8090/api
Other api commands

Status: /api/garage/status
Garage Door Toggle: /api/garage/toggle
Light Toggle: /api/light/toggle
Exit: /api/exit

That's it!
Code
Simulating the button press for the garage door opener circuit. Relay turns on for 500ms, then off. An interesting issue with the relay. As soon the gpio utility exports, it triggers it on. This code exports then unexports a pin that the relay is on.
let relayButtonPressAction = (pin) => {
  gpioExport(pin, "out");
  gpioWrite(pin, 1);
  setTimeout(() => {
    gpioWrite(pin, 0);
    gpioUnexport(pin);
  }, 500);
};

There is one python file that checks the status of the garage door. The configuration was different enough where it needed to be done there. The reed switch should always be true until the door has been opened.
import sys
import RPi.GPIO as gpio

pin = int(sys.argv[1])

gpio.setmode(gpio.BCM)
gpio.setup(pin, gpio.IN, pull_up_down=gpio.PUD_UP)

status = gpio.input(pin)
sys.stdout.write(str(status))

gpio.cleanup()

Open for pull requests! I'm considering on moving all the gpio logic to python then using nodejs as the api router.
Summary
Hardware side is built and working. The api has enough information to check and toggle the garage door. Going to create a script to watch the door status with Node-red(https://nodered.org/)  due to ease of configuration. This project took about 2 days with testing and debugging. Here is a screenshot of the node-red template. Still a work in progress! The flow file(https://github.com/skittleson/garage-pi/blob/master/garage-pi-node-red-flow.json)  is in the repo code.
