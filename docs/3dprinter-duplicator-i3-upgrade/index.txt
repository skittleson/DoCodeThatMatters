TLDR; A "How To" on upgrading a Duplicator i3 with modern 3D printer parts, firmware, and creativity. This post is still progress.
The Duplicator i3 is a common 3D printer that many now consider out dated. Instead of throwing it away and buying a new one, I took the challenge of upgrading and/or replacing parts to modernize it. There is also a lot of resources and parts still available.
The "To-Do" List

- Glass bed

- 1/16 to 1/32 steps for steppers. This provides cleaner and smoother prints.

- Replace existing Melzi board with a MKS Gen 1.4 board (https://amzn.to/2yT1NlY) . This could have been the standard RepRap Arudino Mega 2560 board as well.

JST 2 pin to 3 pin adapters for end stop connectors.

Add JST connector for extruder stepper

Marlin Firmware changes

Invert End stops
#define X_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true // Set to true to invert the logic of the endstop.
#define Y_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true // Set to true to invert the logic of the endstop.
#define Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING true // Set to true to invert the logic of the endstop.
DRV8825 Driver Types uncomment these and replace with DRV8825
  #define X_DRIVER_TYPE  DRV8825
  #define Y_DRIVER_TYPE  DRV8825
  #define Z_DRIVER_TYPE  DRV8825
  #define Z2_DRIVER_TYPE DRV8825
  #define E0_DRIVER_TYPE A4988
  #define E1_DRIVER_TYPE DRV8825
Double step count DRV8825 from 1/16 to 1/32 steps. This comes from the previous Marlin configuration which was #define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT { 80, 80, 400, 100 }. I've kept the extruder on a A4988 chip as the heat was building on too much on it. Calibrate to 0.84 volts.
  #define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT   { 160, 160, 800, 100 }
Invert X and Y directions. Invert extruder direction.
  #define INVERT_X_DIR true
  #define INVERT_Y_DIR true
  #define INVERT_E0_DIR true
Set Z travel limit. #define Z_MAX_POS 180

SD Card Support #define SDSUPPORT.

LCD Support for RepRap Discount Full Smart Controller (https://amzn.to/2JygbSy)  #define REPRAP_DISCOUNT_FULL_GRAPHIC_SMART_CONTROLLER
- DRV8825 calibration. The formula is VREF = Rated motor current / 2 . So a standard NEMA 17 motor is rated at 1.68 amps. Divided by 2 it's .84 volts. I burned out an extruder stepper following this. I dropped it to .6 volts. The steppers were less hot and no performance difference. Checkout

- Replace display. The connectors are backwards for the standard RepRap Discount Full Smart Controller. Some Amazon reviews pointed this out.

- Replace power supply. Found a 30A on Amazon for $20 (https://amzn.to/2XP8wpz) . The current 20A power supply is under powered. It's a known issue with these printers.

- Replace Y bracket.
- Easy access case for MKS Gen board

- Filament sensor

- Cover and mount for power supply

- (Tested this but ended up reverting it) Manual LCD Bed leveling with #define MESH_BED_LEVELING, #define PROBE_MANUALLY and #define LCD_BED_LEVELING. uncommented LCD assisted bed leveling (https://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/probes.html) 

- Auto Bed Leveling using Z Probe Servo

Wiring

Marlin Configuration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msLOR_EfKc (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msLOR_EfKc)  and https://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/probes.html (https://marlinfw.org/docs/configuration/probes.html) . Uncomment the following lines.
  #define AUTO_BED_LEVELING_LINEAR
  #define NUM_SERVOS 3
  #define Z_PROBE_SERVO_NR 0
  #define Z_SERVO_ANGLES { 80, 0 } // This one is important on the servo arm deploy and retraction
  #define USE_ZMAX_PLUG  // I have an extra z max to use so this is used for the switch on the servo arm
  #define Z_CLEARANCE_BETWEEN_PROBES  10 // Z Clearance between probe points
  #define Z_CLEARANCE_MULTI_PROBE     10 // Z Clearance between multiple probes
  #define Z_PROBE_LOW_POINT          -10 // Farthest distance below the trigger-point to go before stopping
  #define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN
  #define Z_MIN_PROBE_PIN 19 // Pin 32 is the RAMPS default but we are using a MKS Gen 1.4 Board
M280 important! This controls the servo. Use this for testing: https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M280.html (https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M280.html)  . Use the values gathered here to set Z_SERVO_ANGLES property.

Get servo 0 angle: M280 P0
Move servo 0 to a 90 degree angle: M280 P0 S90
Move servo 0 to a 0 degree angle: M280 P0 S0
Set marlin config of zprobe offset #define NOZZLE_TO_PROBE_OFFSET { -1, -40, -7.7 }
M420 get/set bed level state https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M420.html (https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M420.html) 
M119 Endstop states
G29 start the auto bed leveling routine.

Lessons Learned

- Learned how to configure and almost build a 3d printer using an existing one.
- Spent way more time than expected.
