As a software engineer, starting with a clean slate in an OS is required often. Usually using containers is the solution to that for development. After some time even your primary OS suffers from bit rot. For Windows, a factory reset gets that back into a clean state. I use A LOT of apps and they can take up to day to install everything but no more! So here is powershell script to get the common apps used on a regular basis.
