An email running away from being cleaned up.
Introduction
My inbox is FULL. Not in the sense of storage capacity but my mental capacity.  Email is here to stay and i have chose not to commit to a zero inbox game.  So this is my attempt to using some code to analyze and clean up existing messages.  Let's get some control back.
Code
TLDR;  the who_has_email_the_most script loops through 11 times by 30 days in an inbox using an IMAP protocol.  Builds a "top FROM" emails then displays it.  The mark_for_deletions script handles removing a single from email address at a time.

Data
Mostly newsletters, some transactional.  Having a time-to-live on some of these emails would make sense.  That's not a feature i'm aware of so lets just do some data deletion. EDIT: there is a feature called Sweep in Outlook.com that does this.
