Hi, I'm Spencer 👋
As a software engineer with a wealth of experience in software development and database design, I am well-versed in a wide range of modern computer languages, with a particular focus on .NET technologies. My expertise extends to building and scaling systems to work seamlessly across multiple platforms, with a strong emphasis on testing and ensuring the success of my fellow developers.
In addition to my professional pursuits, I am also deeply passionate about a variety of technology-related hobbies. I enjoy experimenting with 3D printing, working with Raspberry Pi and Arduino microcontrollers, and exploring the world of home automation. I also enjoy organizing and hosting hackathons, providing an opportunity for others to share in my passion for technology. 
My ultimate goal is to develop software that is efficient, reliable, and user-friendly, and to empower developers to achieve success in their work.
